# Remote Control Deployment System

This deployment system allows you to manage and deploy the `remote-control.js` script to multiple Shelly I4 Plus devices from a central configuration file.

## Overview

Instead of manually editing and uploading the script to each I4 device, you can:
1. Define all your devices and their button mappings in `remote-control-config.json`
2. Run the deployment script to automatically push customized scripts to all devices
3. Update the central config and redeploy when you need to make changes

## Files

- **`remote-control.js`** - The base script template
- **`remote-control-config.json`** - Central configuration file defining all I4 devices and their button mappings
- **`deploy-remote-control.js`** - Node.js deployment script that pushes customized scripts to devices

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your computer (version 12 or higher)
- Network access to your Shelly devices
- Shelly I4 Plus devices on your network

### Initial Configuration

1. Edit `remote-control-config.json` to define your devices:

```json
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "name": "Living Room I4",
      "ip": "192.168.1.100",
      "description": "Living room wall switches",
      "controls": [
        { "ip": "dimmer1.shelly.home", "channel": 0, "description": "Main lights" },
        { "ip": "dimmer1.shelly.home", "channel": 1, "description": "Accent lights" },
        { "ip": "0.0.0.0", "channel": 0, "description": "Disabled" },
        { "ip": "0.0.0.0", "channel": 0, "description": "Disabled" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "scriptId": 1,
  "scriptName": "remote-control"
}
```

**Configuration Fields:**

- **`name`**: Friendly name for the I4 device (for your reference)
- **`ip`**: IP address or mDNS hostname of the I4 device
- **`description`**: Description of the device location/purpose
- **`controls`**: Array of 4 objects (one per input button) defining what each button controls:
  - **`ip`**: IP address or mDNS hostname of the dimmer to control (use `0.0.0.0` to disable)
  - **`channel`**: Channel number on the dimmer (0 = Output 1, 1 = Output 2)
  - **`description`**: What this button controls (for documentation)
- **`scriptId`**: Script ID to use on the device (usually 1)
- **`scriptName`**: Name for the script on the device

## Usage

### Dry Run (Preview)

Before deploying, you can preview what would be deployed:

```bash
node deploy-remote-control.js --dry-run
```

This will show:
- Which devices would be updated
- The configuration for each device
- A preview of the generated script

### Deploy to All Devices

Deploy to all configured devices:

```bash
node deploy-remote-control.js
```

### Deploy to Specific Device

Deploy to only one device:

```bash
node deploy-remote-control.js --device 192.168.1.100
```

### Help

Show usage information:

```bash
node deploy-remote-control.js --help
```

## How It Works

1. **Configuration Loading**: The script reads `remote-control-config.json`
2. **Script Generation**: For each device, it generates a customized version of `remote-control.js` with the device-specific button mappings
3. **Device Connection**: Connects to each Shelly I4 device via HTTP RPC API
4. **Script Deployment**: 
   - Checks if script already exists
   - Stops running script if necessary
   - Updates or creates the script
   - Starts the script automatically
5. **Verification**: Reports success or failure for each device

## Example Workflow

### Adding a New I4 Device

1. Install the physical I4 device and connect it to your network
2. Find its IP address (check your router or Shelly app)
3. Add it to `remote-control-config.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Bedroom I4",
  "ip": "192.168.1.105",
  "description": "Bedroom wall switches",
  "controls": [
    { "ip": "bedroom-dimmer.shelly.home", "channel": 0, "description": "Ceiling light" },
    { "ip": "bedroom-dimmer.shelly.home", "channel": 1, "description": "Reading lamp" },
    { "ip": "0.0.0.0", "channel": 0, "description": "Unused" },
    { "ip": "0.0.0.0", "channel": 0, "description": "Unused" }
  ]
}
```

4. Deploy to just that device:
```bash
node deploy-remote-control.js --device 192.168.1.105
```

### Updating Button Mappings

1. Edit the `controls` array in `remote-control-config.json` for the device you want to change
2. Run deployment (optionally with `--dry-run` first to preview)
3. The script will automatically update the device

### Updating All Devices

If you make changes to the base `remote-control.js` script:

1. Edit `remote-control.js` with your improvements
2. Run deployment to push to all devices:
```bash
node deploy-remote-control.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### Device Unreachable

**Error**: `Device unreachable: connect ETIMEDOUT`

**Solutions**:
- Verify the IP address is correct
- Check that the device is powered on and connected to the network
- Try pinging the device: `ping 192.168.1.100`
- Ensure your computer is on the same network

### Script Deployment Failed

**Error**: `Deployment failed: ...`

**Solutions**:
- Check the device logs in the Shelly web interface
- Verify the device has enough memory for scripts
- Try deploying to just that device with `--device` flag
- Check if the device firmware is up to date

### Wrong Configuration Applied

If a device has the wrong button mappings:

1. Verify the configuration in `remote-control-config.json`
2. Run with `--dry-run` to preview what would be deployed
3. Check that you're deploying to the correct IP address
4. Redeploy to that specific device

### Script Not Starting

If the script deploys but doesn't start:

1. Check the device web interface (Settings â†’ Scripts)
2. Look at the script logs for errors
3. Verify the dimmer IP addresses in the configuration are correct
4. Try manually starting the script from the web interface

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Script ID

By default, scripts use ID 1. If you need a different ID (e.g., if you have multiple scripts):

1. Change `scriptId` in `remote-control-config.json`
2. Redeploy

### Using mDNS Hostnames

Instead of IP addresses, you can use mDNS hostnames:

```json
{
  "ip": "a0dd6c9f5b18.shelly.home",
  "controls": [
    { "ip": "2cbcbba405a4.shelly.home", "channel": 0, "description": "..." }
  ]
}
```

The hostname format is: `[last-12-chars-of-mac].shelly.home`

### Backup Configuration

Before making major changes, backup your configuration:

```bash
cp remote-control-config.json remote-control-config.backup.json
```

## Button Functions Reminder

Each button on the I4 device supports:

- **Single Press**: Toggle light on/off
- **Double Press**: Turn on at 100% brightness
- **Long Press**: Start dimming (alternates between dim up/down)
- **Release**: Stop dimming

## API Reference

The deployment script uses the Shelly Gen2 RPC API:

- `Shelly.GetDeviceInfo` - Get device information
- `Script.List` - List all scripts on device
- `Script.Create` - Create a new script
- `Script.PutCode` - Upload script code
- `Script.SetConfig` - Configure script settings
- `Script.Start` - Start a script
- `Script.Stop` - Stop a script

For more information: [Shelly RPC API Documentation](https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/gen2/)

## Tips

1. **Use descriptive names**: The `description` fields help you remember what each button does
2. **Start with dry-run**: Always preview with `--dry-run` before deploying
3. **Deploy incrementally**: Use `--device` to test on one device before deploying to all
4. **Keep backups**: Save backup copies of your configuration file
5. **Document changes**: Add comments in the config file to track changes
6. **Test after deployment**: Press each button to verify correct operation

## Integration with Other Scripts

This deployment system is specifically for `remote-control.js`. For other scripts in this repository:

- **`garage-control.js`**: Manual installation (usually only one instance)
- **`outdoor-light.js`**: Manual installation (device-specific schedules)
- **`input-forwarder.js`**: Could benefit from similar deployment system
- **`leader-follower-sync.js`**: Manual installation (device-specific followers)

If you have multiple instances of other scripts, you could create similar deployment systems following this pattern.
